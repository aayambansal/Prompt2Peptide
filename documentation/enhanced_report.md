# Prompt2Peptide: Enhanced Publication-Ready Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents an enhanced evaluation of the Prompt2Peptide pipeline, implementing all fast-win improvements for publication readiness.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Constraint System
- **Composition Constraints**: K/R fraction ∈ [0.25, 0.45], D/E fraction ≤ 0.10
- **Charge-Directed Moves**: Preferential mutations based on charge targets
- **Histidine Penalty**: Scale His contribution to 0.15 of full positive charge
- **Two-Phase Search**: (i) Reach charge window, (ii) Lock charge and optimize μH/GRAVY

### 2. Safety-Filtered Main Tables
- **Main Tables**: Only report sequences that pass all safety filters
- **Appendix**: Flagged sequences moved to appendix with detailed reasons
- **Safety Rates**: High safety percentages across all prompt types

### 3. Embedding Separation Quantification
- **Silhouette Scores**: Per-prompt silhouette scores (target ≥0.3)
- **Cluster Separation**: Quantified separation between prompt clusters
- **Centroid Distances**: Measured distances between cluster centroids

### 4. LM Plausibility Calibration
- **AUROC Analysis**: Natural vs generated ESM-LL separability
- **Bootstrap CIs**: Confidence intervals for AUROC estimates
- **Target Range**: AUROC ~0.5–0.7 indicates good similarity to natural peptides

### 5. Failure Mode Analysis
- **Constraint Failures**: 4-6 examples where single constraints fail
- **Fix Demonstrations**: How enhanced moves address each failure
- **Before/After**: Clear demonstration of improvement
